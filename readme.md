We'll develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Python,
which can classify network traffic as either normal or potentially malicious.
This IDS will be trained using a popular dataset in cybersecurity, such as the KDD Cup 1999 dataset.

Data Preprocessing:

Download and preprocess the dataset.
Perform feature engineering to make the data suitable for machine learning.
Model Selection and Training:

Choose a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, or a neural network).
Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment:

Create a simple interface for the IDS to classify new network traffic.

1. Feature Engineering and Dimensionality Reduction
We'll add feature selection using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning
We'll use GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the Random Forest model.

3. Anomaly Detection
We'll implement an Isolation Forest for anomaly detection.

4. Visualization
We'll add visualizations for data exploration and model evaluation.

5. User Interface
We'll create a simple Flask app for user interaction.
